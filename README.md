# SudokuSolver

Sudoku solver is project, whose task is to create library which will generate solved sudoku a then creates solvable sudoku by special algoritm. This algoritm is inspired by work that is referenced down below. Except library, there will be created a console and graphical interface, to play and enjoy sudoku.

To achiave this goal, i choosed a python as a main programing language, because its quick, and easy to understand for other people, who would be interested to try it program by them self. The reason why i start to do this project is because i wonted to learn python to same level and i thing, sudoku is perfect project , if you have some experiences with programing.

All the important things will be posted and explained here.
